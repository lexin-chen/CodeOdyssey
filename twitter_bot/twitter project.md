I completed two bots for this projects as described on my twitterbot description. 

Bot #1- whenever an account mentions me @iae101lexchen using the hashtag, #goodday, an automated message from the bot will be replied to the user with <#goodday to you too, bless you>. 
You may need to physically tweet <@iae101lexchen #goodday> for this to work because existing tweets that have been replied to are duplicates. 
**The account you are using must to be public and/or that account needs to follow my account @iae101lexchen**


Bot #2 - When ran, it will display the number of days until New Years 2021. This bot only runs once a day because additional tweets would be a duplicate

Both should be completed when ran once. 
It functions normally in the three days that I have tested it.
In the case that it does not, please comment out bot #2 when running bot #1 and vice versa.
